Arcade Style Snake Game
This game is a work-a-like for an old SNAKE game that came out on old cell phones years ago.
I had to make it for a PYTHON class I am enrolled in.
Run it in PYTHON, it uses the arrow keys to move the snake direction.
Go after the yellow food pellet to jain a point.
Every time you eat food your snake gets a bit longer.
Run into yourself - game over
Run into the wall sides - game over
Good luck!
